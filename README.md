WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS EXERCISE:

Started off without reading the instructions
**Need to practise on building logic and work flow:**

- write down the problem and break it down to the smallest steps possible 
  (= writing Pseudo code)
    Best scenario: each step = 1 line of code;
  
- When starting actual code: TEST almost everything with Console.log
  if there's a problem: start debugging (look up documentation, update, test)
- if still stuck: browse through the documentation and DON'T STRESS ABOUT LOSING TIME !!! because all the info you go through is still knowledge you gain.
- LIMIT TIME WHEN STUCK TO 10MIN !!!
- Don't wait too long to ask for help
- MORE PRACTISE IN FREE TIME!!! -> https://www.codewars.com/
